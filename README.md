# üß† Smart Recipe Generator

### An AI-powered recipe recommendation app that suggests personalized recipes based on user-provided ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking filters.

---

## üìã Overview

**Smart Recipe Generator** is a modern web application that helps users discover recipes effortlessly by leveraging ingredient recognition and smart matching algorithms.  
Users can input ingredients manually or through image uploads, apply dietary filters, and receive tailored recipe suggestions complete with nutritional information, cooking instructions, and substitution recommendations.

## üöÄ Features

### üîπ Core Functionality

- **Ingredient Input:**  
  Users can type ingredients or select from a predefined list.  
  Supports both manual input and image-based recognition (via AI/ML API).

- **Recipe Generation:**  
  Smart algorithm suggests multiple recipes that can be prepared using available ingredients.

- **Nutritional Insights:**  
  Each recipe includes calorie count, protein, carbs, and fat breakdown.

- **Custom Filters:**  
  Filter by cooking difficulty, cuisine type, time to cook, or dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).

- **Personalization:**  
  Save, rate, and revisit favorite recipes. Future suggestions improve based on feedback.

## üß† Recipe Matching Logic

The core of the app is the **Recipe Matching Algorithm**, which:

1. Tokenizes and normalizes user input ingredients.
2. Matches them against recipe ingredient lists.
3. Calculates a **match score** based on overlap and priority.
4. Suggests top recipes sorted by relevance.
5. Provides substitution suggestions for missing ingredients.
